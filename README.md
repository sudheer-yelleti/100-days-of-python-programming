# 100 Days of Python Programming

_A hands-on learning journey—each day introduces a new Python challenge or mini-project, covering core programming constructs, OOP, functional techniques, APIs, and more. This repository tracks my progress through 100 days of focused development, with each folder labelled by day and containing solutions, notes and improvements._

## Overview

This repository documents a 100-day Python learning challenge. Each day focuses on a new concept, algorithm, or mini-project, gradually building skills from beginner-friendly syntax to advanced OOP, web APIs, automation, and more.

Projects range from password generators, habit trackers, and simple games to web scraping, API consumers, GUI tools, and HTML+CSS-based applications.

---

## Repository Structure

- Each **day’s folder** is labeled `Day xx/` and contains Python or web-based projects:
  - `main.py`, `task.py`, etc. for main code
  - Supporting resources (e.g., `README.md`, `index.html`, `styles.css`)
  - Some folders include multiple sub-projects or iterations.

## Highlights by Day

### Day 5: Password Generator Project
Beginner logic to generate secure passwords using lists and randomization.

### Day 7: Hangman Game
Classic game logic using word lists, input validation, and loops.

### Day 16: OOP Coffee Machine
Object-oriented programming concepts applied to simulate a coffee vending machine (`CoffeeMaker`, `Menu`, etc.).

### Day 29–30: Password Manager
Intro to GUI (Tkinter), persistent storage (`data.json`), input validation, and file read/write.

### Day 34: Quizzler App
Quiz game using MVC pattern, data abstraction, and custom UI in Python.

### Day 35: Rain Alerter
Weather API consumption, geolocation, Twilio integration for SMS alerts.

### Day 37: Habit Tracker
Using the Pixela API for recording habits, implementing retry logic and logging for robust workflows.

### Day 41–45: Web & HTML/CSS Projects
Movie ranking lists, birthday invite web pages, web scraping with `BeautifulSoup`, motivational poster creation.

### Day 48+: Automation and Web Scraping
Automated event data extraction, statistics gathering, form submission using Selenium and web scraping tools.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (primary, >97%)
  - Core syntax, OOP, functions
  - Web scraping (`requests`, `BeautifulSoup`)
  - GUI programming (`Tkinter`)
  - APIs (`requests`, `Twilio`, `Pixela`)
  - Automation (`Selenium`)
  - Data/storage (`json`, file I/O)
- **HTML/CSS**: Simple front-end mini-projects (birthday invites, movie lists, memes).
- **External Services & APIs**: Twilio, Pixela, OpenWeather, Wayback Machine.

## How to Use

1. **Browse**: Clone this repository and browse each day's folder for code, notes, and required resources.
2. **Run**: Most Python scripts are self-contained and runnable via:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
   Some projects (e.g., habit tracker, rain alerter) may require API keys or environment variables—refer to code comments in each main file.
3. **Web projects**: Open `.html` files in your browser.
